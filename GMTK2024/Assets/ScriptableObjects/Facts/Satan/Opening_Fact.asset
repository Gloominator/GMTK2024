  question: 
  frontFact: Hello, my name is S... Uh, John. Better be quick, there's a few hundred
    people behind me that you have to judge. I was an angel for a while, and then
    spent my life cleaning up the garbage. Do yourself a favor if you're new to this
    whole thing, call me for bluffs, promise you won't hurt my feelings.
